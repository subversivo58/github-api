# github-api

A higher-level wrapper around the Github API. Intended for the browser ES6 module based


### Notice:

This is a free adaptation of the amazing [Github.js](https://github.com/github-tools/github) library to support ES6 modules.

This project was based on version [3.3.0](https://github.com/github-tools/github/tree/v3.3.0) and it is not based on a fork so there is no forecast for immediate updates from updates from the original source.


### Upload binary files:

Yes you can. The original library was slightly modified to allow for this.

You can see these changes on the [following lines](https://github.com/subversivo58/github-api/blob/master/Repository.mjs#L269,L286)

A low-level wrapper was designed to allow this: [see gist](https://gist.github.com/subversivo58/9ad5273e931b3c223c4826c5ef5403f5)


### Disclainer:
